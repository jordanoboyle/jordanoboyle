- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jordanoboyle
#About Me:
  - Not a great story to tell. But I certainly do enjoy Platypuses...mammals that lay eggs. Seriously, why be so confusing with animals. 

## Current Working Knowledge
  - ðŸŒ± JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Python, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React.js
## Learning 
  - Currently expanding my knowledge in using Vanilla JS to build reasonably robust web applications. Below, many of the repositories feature that learning process.
  - Also working on learning more about Phaser so I can build a fun little browser based game for others to enjoy.
